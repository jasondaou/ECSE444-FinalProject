# ECSE444-FinalProject

A study on direct vs. iterative solvers for linear systems.
Compares the time performance of one iterative and one direct solver (Conjugate gradient, and Cholesky LU decomposition).

To compile on Linux type:
    >> make
    >> ./output

In order to see the output x of both solvers, uncomment the printf and print_matrix statements in testing.c
